Notes:
getCollisionBoundingBox() returns the entity's *solid* collision bounding box; it's generally not used for living entities, but rather for eg. boats
getEntityBoundingBox() returns the normal collision bounding box generally used for living entities



Low priority:
Look into multiple hitboxes if a situation comes up where they'd be useful
